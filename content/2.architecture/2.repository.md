## Repository Structure

### Monorepo Architecture

Currencia is organized as a monorepo using Turborepo, which provides several advantages for managing a complex application ecosystem:

```bash
currencia/
├── apps/                 
│   ├── app/             # Main Nuxt application
│   └── formatter/       # Standalone Nitro formatter
├── packages/            # Shared internal packages
│   ├── cryptos/         # Crypto libraries
│   ├── mongo/           # MongoDB utilities
│   └── utils/           # Shared utilities
└── scripts/            # Build and maintenance scripts
```

### Turborepo Benefits

**Pipeline Optimization**
- **Remote Caching**: Faster builds by reusing previously built assets
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs tasks across packages simultaneously
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuilds what changed
- **Task Dependencies**: Automatically manages build order

**Workspace Management**
- **Centralized Dependencies**: Shared node_modules for consistent versions
- **Selective Execution**: Run commands on specific packages
- **Cross-Package References**: Easy imports between packages
- **Unified Tooling**: Consistent development experience

**Development Experience**
- **Task Pipelines**: Defined in `turbo.json`
```json [turbo.json]
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Package Organization

**Apps: Standalone applications:**
- Packages: Shared internal libraries
- Scripts: Maintenance and build utilities

**This architecture enables:**
- Code sharing between applications
- Consistent development practices
- Efficient build processes
•	Easy maintenance and updates
