## Data Providers

Currencia collects real-time cryptocurrency market data through multiple providers. Each provider is built with Bun runtime and operates independently to collect data into MongoDB.

### Core Features

- **Runtime**: All providers built with Bun for high performance
- **Multithreading**: Parallel data collection
- **Raw Data**: Direct storage of unprocessed data in MongoDB
- **Crypto List**: All providers use `@currencia/cryptos` package for available cryptocurrencies
- **CLI Configuration**: Customizable via Commander

### Available Providers

```bash
# List of data providers
- CoinMarketCap Scraper
- CryptoCompare Scraper
- Kraken API
- Sentiment Analysis (Azure VPS)
```

### Common Architecture

#### Provider Configuration

Options:
 - `--threads <number>`    Number of parallel threads
 - `--verbose`             Enable verbose logging
 - `--crypto <crypto>`     Specific crypto to scrap

#### Data Flow

1.	Provider collects data based on available cryptos
2.	Raw data stored directly in MongoDB
3.	No preprocessing or transformation

#### Performance

- Bun runtime for optimal performance
- Configurable thread count for parallel collection
- Adjustable collection intervals
- Independent operation of each provider
